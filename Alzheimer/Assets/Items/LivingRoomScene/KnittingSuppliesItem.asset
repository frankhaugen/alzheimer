  Paragraphs:
  - It was her big passion to knit. She would knit socks for everyone, once, even
    the mailman got a pair
  - Oh how I miss the being irritated by the sound of the needles clacking; it would
    keep me from lounging on the sofa for too long...
  - Now, the memory is a distant echo, almost audible in the defening silence of
    the house
