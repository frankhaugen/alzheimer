  Paragraphs:
  - A cabinet is a box-shaped piece of furniture with doors and/or drawers for storing
    miscellaneous items. Some cabinets stand alone while others are built in to a
    wall or are attached to it like a medicine cabinet. Cabinets are typically made
    of wood, coated steel, or synthetic materials. Commercial grade cabinets, which
    differ in the materials used, are called casework, casegoods, or case furniture.
